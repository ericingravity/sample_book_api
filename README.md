## sample_book_api

A small sample book API in Python and Flask to help me better understand API backends. Also a sample Postman collection for testing it.

To run, I recommend creating a virtual environment first and activating it. Then install flask and flask_sqlalchemy using pip. Finally, run the script.

```
$ python -m venv vdir
$ source vdir/bin/activate
$ pip install flask flask_sqlalchemy
$ python api.py
```
